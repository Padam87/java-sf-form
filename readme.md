# What is this?

When creating APISs with Symfony, FOSRestBundle, and JMSSerializer, the serialized form error json is wee bit unorthodox. This is a helper to correctly deserialize the json in your android project, while keeping the symfony form nesting intact.

For now, this is not intended to function as a lib, just copy it over to your repo.
